Audition is bringing the power of version control to whiteboarding. Whether you're sketching diagrams, brainstorming ideas, or learning new concepts, Audition provides an intuitive way to iterate on your drawings while maintaining copies of your work as you go.

## Features

- Create multiple versions of a drawing and explore different ideas without losing previous work.

- Easily toggle between different branches of a diagram to compare different versions of a drawing.

- Maintains a history of your modifications so you can revert changes when needed.

- Visualize your changes in a graph view displaying all branches and drawing versions.


## Why Audition?

Traditional whiteboards or drawing apps can become cluttered and cumbersome when experimenting with different approaches. Audition solves this by letting you create drafts of existing drawings and branch off into new ideas without disrupting your main work. This makes it an invaluable tool for:

- Creating flowcharts and diagrams

- Brainstorming and concept mapping

- Creating educational content

- Learning computer algorithms

- Designing wireframes

- And much more!
